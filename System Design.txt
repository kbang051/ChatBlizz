Redis Architecture - 

-------------------------------------------
Caching Friend Requests:

- Currently, we are caching friend requests sent to a person with timestamp (sendFriendRequest controller).
  Why? We are trying to use this cached info when a person wants to view pending requests (a call made 
  to displayFriendRequest controller). 

  The pending requests are currenty going to change for a user when he accepts/declines friendShip request.
  If there is not recent activity, this means we can display the old requests. Therefore, in this case 
  displayFriendRequest controller can send cached data.
