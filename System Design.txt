Redis Architecture - 

-------------------------------------------
Caching Friend Requests:

- Currently, we are caching friend requests sent to a person with timestamp (sendFriendRequest controller).
  Why? We are trying to use this cached info when a person wants to view pending requests (a call made 
  to displayFriendRequest controller). 

  The pending requests are currenty going to change for a user when he accepts/declines friendShip request.
  If there is not recent activity, this means we can display the old requests. Therefore, in this case 
  displayFriendRequest controller can send cached data. 

  Modified timestamp to TIMESTAMP(3) in table messages, as it was causing errors at the time of infinite scrolling.
